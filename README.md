This is a Python-based face detection application that utilizes OpenCV for detecting faces in images and video streams. It is the foundation for future development, where I plan to add more features to make it even more functional and user-friendly.

Features

	•	Real-time face detection using your webcam or video files.
	•	Face detection in static images.
	•	Easy to use with a simple, intuitive interface.

Technologies Used

	•	Python
	•	OpenCV

How It Works

	1.	The app captures images from the webcam or processes input images/videos.
	2.	It uses OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascades for face detection.
	3.	Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes.
